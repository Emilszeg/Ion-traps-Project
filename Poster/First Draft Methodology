A diode laser is directed into a reflection grating, which spatially separates the various component wavelengths of the beam. The first order diffraction is directed into a mirror mounted on a high-precision rotation stage, which reflects a specific and adjustable wavelength back into the diode laser, providing optical feedback. The zeroth order diffraction is used as the output for our ECDL after being directed into an optical fibre, which is subsequently used as the input for our spectrometer.
