We reassembled the spectrometer now that the CCD was working and tried to measure the flashlight with the spectrometer but it turned out that the flashlight also emitted light not constantly. This resulted in the output of the CCD to flicker on and off. Turning the light on and off a couple of times solved this issue for a moment but it returned always. When we switched out the flashlight for another one the output was stable. We then rebuilt our setup once again to prepare it for calibrating theoretically and experimentally. We think that the theoretical calibration is prone to many measurment errors such as measuring distances and angles and therefor is less acurate then the experimental calibration. We decided to build the setup so that we could see if we can even measure the dim neon light and decide if we are even able to calibrate the setup experimentally.

Once the spectrometer is successfully calibrated, we can begin with gathering data for our animation and poster. This means we will analyse separate light sources using our spectrometer. Most importantly we will be measuring the effect that optical feedback from an ECDL has on the character of the emitted light.
